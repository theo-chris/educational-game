# Manual Testing

## A registered user can reset their password
- in order to reset my password I have to create an account which I did previously
- then I must log out of my account and click the 'log in' button on the top right of the home page
- on the log in page there is a button called 'forgot your password?' which I had to click in order to reset my password
- I then had to enter my username and click verify
- once that was done I was prompted with my security question, which I answered on the sign up page 'what is your favourite colour?
- I was then taken to a page where I could reset my password, there were two boxes to ensure that I type in the correct password. The password is hidden using black circles, which would be an issue if there was not a verification to ensure that both match (as I could type the wrong password and be unaware)
- after I was finished and clicked 'reset password' I was taken to the home page where I could log in again
- I tried logging in with my new password and it worked, I was taken to the main page where I can select games

## A user can see an Easy Maths question
- I had to log in by clicking the top right 'login' button, then I had to enter my credentials 
- once I did so I was taken to the main page where I had the option to click either 'english' or 'math'
- when I clicked the 'math' image button the game automatically starts and I can see the easy math question 

## A user can answer an Easy Maths question
- the question appeared on the screen automatically
- I then had to choose the correct answer from the 4 options below the question
- in order to answer I have to click one of the answers, which will allow me to move to the next question

## A user is prompted to the next question when the time runs out
- whilst answering the maths questions there is a timer (you have 10 seconds to complete the question)
- once the 10 seconds are finished I was prompted with an alert that said 'You ran out of time! Progress onto the next question'
- when I clicked ok I was prompted to the next question and the timer goes back to 10 seconds again

## A user can see the time limit while playing Easy Maths
- once the game started I saw that there was a timer for each question (10 seconds)
- everytime I answered a new question the timer was reset to 10 seconds
- the timer is displayed clearly at the top and it counts down how long I had left to complete the question

## A user can see their score while playing Easy Maths
- whilst answering the questions there is a 'score' box in order for me to keep track of my points
- I saw that everytime I answered the question correctly the score would increase
- however, it would stay the same if I did not answer correctly
- the 'score' box is bold and obvious, meaning that the user can see their score 

## A user can play Hard Maths right after finishing Easy Maths
- once I started the game I found that the first 4 questions were single digits (easy maths)
- they included both addition and subtraction 
- once those 4 questions were finished 4 more questions appeared
- these questions were all double digits (hard maths), again included both subtraction and addition
- this proves that I can play hard maths once I have completed easy maths

## A user can see green or red button highlight for right or wrong answers respectively
- once the questions appear I had to answer them as there is a timer
- when I clicked the correct answer the button I chose turns to green and moves onto the next question
- however when I click the wrong answer the button I chose turns to red and moves onto the next question
- proving that the colours change depending on if you're right or wrong

## A user can carry the remaining time from Easy to Hard 
- Once I have completed the questions on the easy mode, the remaining time from the questions I answered correctly is carried forward to the Hard Questions as a reserve time.
- When the normal time runs out, the reserve time is being used.
- If the reserve time reaches 0 after the normal timer reaches 0 I skip to the next question. 
- If I answer corrctly during the reserve time is moved to the next question.
- This proves I can carry the remaining time from easy questions to hard questions, if and only if I have answered correctly in the easy questions.

## A user can see an Easy English question
- I had to log in by clicking the top right 'login' button, then I had to enter my credentials 
- once I did so I was taken to the main page where I had the option to click either 'english' or 'math'
- when I clicked the 'english' image button the game automatically starts and I can see the easy english question 'what is this' along with the image of what the item is

## A user can answer an Easy English question
- the question appeared on the screen automatically
- I then had decide which image was shown on the screen and select the option that fit the image (there are 4 answers to chose from)
- in order to answer the question I have to click one of the answers, which will allow me to move to the next question

## A user can see and answer a Hard English question
- in order to enter the 'hard stage' I had to answer the 4 easy english questions
- I saw that the hard questions appear as the easy questions do
- there are 5 answer boxes for the hard questions and each option is 5-6 letters long, whilst in the easy game I found that they were 3-4 letters long
- answering the questions was the same as the easy questions, which I found to be very simple to do

## A user can see their score while playing English
- whilst answering the questions there is a 'score' box in order for me to keep track of my points
- I saw that everytime I answered the question correctly the score would increase
- however, it would stay the same if I did not answer correctly
- the 'score' box is bold and obvious, meaning that the user can see their score 

## A user can see the time limit while playing English
- once the game started I saw that there was a timer for each question (15 seconds)
- everytime I answered a new question the timer was reset to 15 seconds
- I saw that there are 12 seconds for the hard questions
- the timer is displayed clearly at the top left of the screen and it counts down how long I had left to complete the question

## A user is prompted to the next English question when the time runs out
- whilst answering the english questions there is a timer (you have 15 seconds to complete the question or 12 on hard more)
- once the 15/12 seconds are finished I was prompted with an alert that said 'You ran out of time! Progress onto the next question'
- when I clicked ok I was prompted to the next question and the timer goes back to 15/12 seconds again

## A user can carry the remaining time from Easy to Hard (English)
- once I had completed the four easy mode questions, the remaining time from the questions I answered correctly is carried forward to the hard questions as a reserve time
- when the normal time runs out, the reserve time starts being used
- if the reserve time reaches 0 after the normal timer reaches 0 I skip to the next question
- if I answer corrctly during the reserve time, I moved to the next question
- this proves I can carry the remaining time from easy questions to hard questions, if and only if I have answered correctly in the easy questions

## A user is prompted to the next subject after they finish the one they started with
- I started by playing the maths game, easy to hard
- once I had completed the 4th question on the 'hard maths' mode, I was prompted by a screen that stated 'Want to Continue? 'Moving to English mode in 3...2...1' (it counts down from 3)
- when the timer hit 0 I was automatically taking to the english mode

## A user can carry the remaining time from the first game into the second one
- I started on the English game which I completed with 54 seconds in my remaining time
- I found the maths harder than the English and the 54 seconds was carried into that remaining time
- I found this useful as I found that I needed more time to answer the maths questions than I did the english
- therefore the fact that the remaining time from the first game can be carried into the second game is useful

## A user can see a message confirming correct or incorrect answers
- whilst answering the questions I saw an alert for the right/wrong answers
- if I answered a question and it was the right one it would state 'well done, correct!' in green
- if I answered a question and it was the wrong one it would state 'oops, wrong!' in red

## A user can go back to the main page when they finish the first game
- once the I had finished the first game (easy and hard) I could choose whether I would like to continue onto the next subject or go to the main page
- I had to click 'exit to main menu', if I didn't click that I would've been taken to the next game (Which was maths)
- once I did that I was able to chose a different game or log out 

## A user can see a summary page after they finish the game
- once I had finished the game I was taken to a summary page
- on the summary page I was able to see my highest score, my maths score, my english score and the highest score I had to beat (with their username next to it)
- below that I had the option to play the game again if I wanted to 

## A guest can register after completing a game 
- once I had completed the game and reached the summary page I had the option to 'signup and save' if I wanted to save my high score
- when I clicked that button I was taken to the sign up page where I could register as a user

## A visitor of the application can contact the support team
- I had a question to ask the support team, in order for them to answer my query I had to scroll to the bottom of the first page (pre log-in)
- it was clearly stated 'contact us' and it had a white background to show it was separate to the game
- I had to enter my name, email address, subject and my message, then my message was sent

## A user can see a tutorial video
- I wanted to see how the game worked/how to play
- in order to do this I had to log in, once I had done so I had to click the image that stated 'Tutorial, watch the tutorial', which is on the home page, alongside the English game and the Maths game
- once I did so a video (2:29 minutes long) appeared and I had to click play to watch it

## A user can see a leaderboard
- I found that I didn't need to have to be logged in order to access the leaderboard 
- all I had to do was click 'leaderboards' at the top right hand sign of the landing (pre log in), however I can still access it from the main and summary pages
- once I did that I was taken to the leaderboard page
- I can choose the amount of entries that are displayed, as well as sort the table by their title (number, username, score), however, currently the default is highest to lowest score
