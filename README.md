# Educational-Game
 An educational game for kids to learn simple maths and english.
 I was a software developer in this group project ( mainly back-end), but I would contribute in all areas to assist my group.
 Won an award for the best software engineering group project in the Department of Informatics at University of Leicester.

# Group Activities
 We followed Scrum throughout the project, and we would develop the application depending on what the client requested during our sprint planning(2 week sprints). This project was very helpful to reflect how a real project could be like.
 We also presented the work at the end of the project, scoring the highest possible marks.
